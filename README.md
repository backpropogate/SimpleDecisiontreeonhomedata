# SimpleDecisiontreeonhomedata
This is just a simple decision tree machine learning model on iowa home data. The Target prediction Is the Sale price of the house. Although This doesn't seem quite impressive because its only a decision tree, Its important to understand that just because I probably could of used a deep neural network for this it was completely uncalled for. I feel sometimes simpler models can be more effective. I will be doing more complicated models In a later project.
